## Match Generation Algorithms

The app uses sophisticated algorithms to create balanced matches in both singles and doubles modes:

## Singles Mode Algorithm

### Court Capacity Logic
- **Sufficient Courts** (`courts Ã— 2 â‰¥ active players`):
  - Even player count: Create matches for all players
  - Odd player count: Randomly exclude one player, create matches with remaining
- **Limited Courts** (`courts Ã— 2 < active players`):
  - Randomly select `courts Ã— 2` players for matches
  - Remaining players sit out

### Match Creation
1. **Gender Filtering**:
   - **Same**: Separate players by gender, create matches within each gender group
   - **Any**: Create matches from the entire player pool
2. **Skill Matching**:
   - **Individual**: Prefer opponents within 1 skill level, sort by skill for optimal pairing
   - **Random**: Completely random opponent pairing using Fisher-Yates shuffle
3. **Court Assignment**: All matches get randomized court numbers

## Doubles Mode Algorithm

### Court Capacity Logic
- **Sufficient Courts** (`courts Ã— 4 â‰¥ active players`):
  - If player count is divisible by 4: Create all doubles matches
  - If remainder exists: Create doubles + special court (singles/Canadian doubles)
- **Limited Courts** (`courts Ã— 4 < active players`):
  - Randomly select `courts Ã— 4` players for matches
  - Remaining players sit out

### Team Formation
1. **Fixed Teams**: Pre-defined partnerships are included first and distributed evenly
2. **Gender Rules**:
   - **Mixed**: Creates male/female pairs when possible
   - **Same**: Creates all-male or all-female teams
   - **Any**: Any gender combination
3. **Skill Balancing**:
   - **Individual**: Groups players with similar individual skill levels
   - **Random**: Completely random team selection
   - **Team**: Used for match pairing (see below)

### Match Pairing
- **Random/Individual Skill**: Teams are randomly shuffled before pairing into matches
- **Team Skill**: Teams are sorted by total team skill and paired with similar skill opponents
- **Court Assignment**: All matches get randomized court numbers (fixed teams don't cluster)

### Special Matches (Doubles Mode Only)
- **3 Players**: Canadian doubles (2 vs 1)
- **2 Players**: Singles match
- **1 Player**: Sits out

## Key Algorithm Features
- **True Randomization**: Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
- **Optimal Skill Matching**: Sophisticated pairing logic for individual skill preferences
- **Fixed Team Distribution**: Prevents clustering on early courts (doubles only)
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful handling when preferred gender combinations aren't possible
- **Smart Court Usage**: Maximizes player participation within court constraints
- **Gender Balance**: Intelligent distribution when using "same gender" filtering
