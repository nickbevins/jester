## Match Generation Algorithm

The app uses sophisticated algorithms to create balanced matches following this logic:

### Court Capacity Logic
- **Sufficient Courts** (`courts Ã— 4 â‰¥ active players`):
  - If player count is divisible by 4: Create all doubles matches
  - If remainder exists: Create doubles + special court (singles/Canadian doubles)
- **Limited Courts** (`courts Ã— 4 < active players`):
  - Randomly select `courts Ã— 4` players for matches
  - Remaining players sit out

### Team Formation
1. **Fixed Teams**: Pre-defined partnerships are included first and distributed evenly
2. **Gender Rules**:
   - **Mixed**: Creates male/female pairs when possible
   - **Same**: Creates all-male or all-female teams
   - **Random**: Any gender combination
3. **Skill Balancing**:
   - **Similar**: Groups players with similar individual skill levels
   - **Random**: Completely random team selection
   - **Balanced**: Used for match pairing (see below)

### Match Pairing
- **Random Skill**: Teams are randomly shuffled before pairing into matches
- **Balanced Skill**: Teams are sorted by total team skill and paired with similar skill opponents
- **Court Assignment**: All matches get randomized court numbers (fixed teams don't cluster)

### Special Matches
- **3 Players**: Canadian doubles (2 vs 1)
- **2 Players**: Singles match
- **1 Player**: Sits out

### Key Features
- **True Randomization**: Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
- **Fixed Team Distribution**: Prevents clustering on early courts
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful handling when preferred gender combinations aren't possible
- **Smart Court Usage**: Maximizes player participation within court constraints
